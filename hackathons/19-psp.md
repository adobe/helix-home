# Helix Operations Workshop XIX

February 2nd to 6th 2026, ACE Hotel Palm Springs, CA

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be done to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

We will meet up at the ACE Hotel in Palm Springs, CA (Again).

#### Travel

Palm Springs (PSP) is an international airport, with direct flights from many overseas and EMEA locations.

You can either fly directly into LAX and grab an uber/lyft which is between 2-4 hours depending on traffic, or if you have a stopover in a US city that connects to PSP, you can fly directly to PSP or alternatively fly to ONT and then ONT is more reliably 1h15 to Palm Springs.

### Goals

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

Put down the topic and the people that would like to discuss it:

The theme of this offsite is to be determined based on Q1 2026 priorities and customer needs.

#### Ideas / Suggestions / Topics Collection

Let's make the list of topics more of operational tasks, than garage week style explorations.
