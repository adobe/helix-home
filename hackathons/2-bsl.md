### Location

How to come: [hackathonSeptBaselHowToCome.md](hackathonSeptBaselHowToCome.md)

Booking flights in and out of BSL or ZHR and a hotel in Basel is a good bet.

### Goal

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

As a result of the last Hackathon, we've changed the development environment and delivery pipeline quite massively, so as a level set/intro to helix we will walk through where we are and how things work for development and the publibly accessable "live" version.

For the Hackathon, we will be trying to get to a place where we can do an additional iteration of the a couple of the [markdown repos](https://github.com/adobeio/adobeio-documentation/blob/master/events/index.md) for [adobe.io](https://www.adobe.io/apis/cloudplatform/events/documentation.html) documentation and get to a place where those are working seamlessly from existing markdown in github to a live site that looks and feels like [adobe.io](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/dreamweaver.html). 

As a stretch goal we would like to get to a place the marketing pages on adobe.io can also be represented in markdown and are rendered inspired by the spark page rendering with a custom header and footer.
For the sake of the Hackathon we are going to assume that all content is authored directly in Markdown on GitHub.

A couple of things we want to validate are:

- nontrivial content delivery using Helix
- responsive content using Helix
- development set-up and experience when building Helix components
- road to production level live delivery for adobe.io
