### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

### Lodging

Recommended hotels:

- Any hotel in Strasbourg city center should be at walking distance
- [Hôtel Les Haras](http://www.les-haras-hotel.com/) - (previous planned location) is at 10mins walking distance. Still a good choice.

### Goal

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

* on-call poc: debrief the 3-months trial, gather on-callees' feedback and define next steps (improve / change / do differently...)
* performathon? https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/issues/935
* helix-content API? https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/issues/292
* backlog grooming? https://github.com/orgs/adobe/projects/2 has a LOT of issues, some of which are gathering dust...
* Write integration tests for helix-pages (mainly tests on production): https://github.com/adobe/helix-pages/issues/8
* look at parcel 2.0 and try to unify all scripts in one bundle (action) and eventually replace webpack.
