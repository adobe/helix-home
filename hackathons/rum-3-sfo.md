# Rumathon III

January 20th to 24th 2025, San Francisco, CA (Adobe Office)

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an rumathon workshop, are you going to sample RUM all day?

Trying to get as much of the virtual team together, the goal is to have high-bandwidth exchanges on the current state and next steps of RUM. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

In the (a) San Francisco office. We don't have a room yet, but it will likely have windows.

#### Travel

Fly into SFO and BART will take you to the city.
