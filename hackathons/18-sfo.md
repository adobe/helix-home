# Helix Operations Workshop XVIII

November 10th to 14th 2025, San Francisco, CA (Adobe Office)

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be done to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

We will meet up at the Adobe San Francisco office at 601 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. The office is located in the historic Baker & Hamilton Building (built in 1905) in the SOMA (South of Market) district. We'll have a room with windows.

#### Travel

Fly into SFO:
- From SFO, take BART to downtown San Francisco (any downtown station)
- The office is about a 12-minute walk from the nearest BART stations
- Alternatively, the 4th and King Caltrain station is very close to the office (5-minute walk)
- The office is also accessible via Muni lines 19, 292, TC, and several others

##### Accommodation

Recommended hotels within walking distance in the SOMA district:
- **Hyatt Regency San Francisco Downtown SOMA** - About 15-20 minute walk, good neighborhood with restaurants
- **LUMA Hotel San Francisco** - 7-minute walk from Oracle Park area
- **Hyatt Place San Francisco/Downtown** - Very close, 3-minute walk from Oracle Park
- **Hotel Via** - Located in South Beach neighborhood, very close to the office
- **Canopy by Hilton San Francisco SoMa** - Within walking distance, near Moscone Center
- **W San Francisco** - Located in the heart of SOMA district

The Intercontinental San Francisco in the Financial District is also an option, though it's a bit further. Most SOMA hotels are safer and more convenient for accessing the Adobe office.

### Goals

Put down the topic and the people that would like to discuss it:

The theme of this offsite is to be determined based on Q4 priorities and customer needs.
