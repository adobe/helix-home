# Helix Operations Workshop XVIII

November 10th to 14th 2025, San Francisco, CA (Adobe Office)

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be done to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

We will meet up at the Adobe San Francisco office. The office is located in downtown San Francisco, and yes, we'll have a room with windows.

#### Travel

Fly into SFO and BART will take you to the city. The office is accessible via public transportation.

##### Accommodation

The closest hotel in walking distance is the Intercontinental San Francisco. The hotel is good, the walk to the office, while not terrible, involves seeing some of the rougher parts of the city. Alternative accommodations in the Financial District or Union Square areas are also convenient.

### Goals

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

Put down the topic and the people that would like to discuss it:

The theme of this offsite is to be determined based on Q4 priorities and customer needs.

#### Ideas / Suggestions / Topics Collection

Let's make the list of topics more of operational tasks, than garage week style explorations.
