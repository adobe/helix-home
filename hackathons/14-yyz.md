# Helix Operations Workshop XIV

August 19th to 23rd 2024, Toronto, Canada
---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be done to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

We have booked a hackathon space in downtown Toronto.  Address: 366 Adelaide St. West, suite 601

#### Travel

Toronto (YYZ) is an international airport, with direct flights from many US and EMEA locations.

Toronto has good public transport, don't rent a car. You can take the UP Express from the airport to Union Station in the city center, and then walk or take a taxi to the hotel.

Hotel recommendation:  Ace Hotel Toronto is a few minutes walk from the office location, and available to book via Navan
