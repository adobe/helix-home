# Helix Operations Workshop XIV

August 19th to 23rd 2024, office location TBD, Toronto, Canada

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be done to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty 
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on 
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.
