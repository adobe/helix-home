# Helix Operations Workshop XIII

April 15th to 19th 2024, Village Berlin Workshop Space, Berlin, Germany

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be done to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty 
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on 
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

We've booked a workshop Space at Village Berlin, Kurfürstenstraße 31, 10785 Berlin, Germany.

#### Travel

Berlin (BER) is an international airport, but most flights from the US will require a connection. If you plan to visit the Basel office as part of this trip, booking a separate Easyjet flight between Berlin and Basel is the cheapest option.

Berlin has good public transport, don't rent a car. You can take the S-Bahn from the airport to the city center, and then walk or take a taxi to the hotel.

The 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin is a 5 minute walk from Berlin Zoo S-Bahn station and 25 minutes on foot or 10 minutes by Subway from the workshop location. It is available on Navan.

### Goals

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

Put down the topic and the people that would like to discuss it:

The theme of this offsite is to make considerable progress on getting customers onboarded to Helix 5. For this, we group the work into two tracks, both with the goal of iproving live sites. For each of the tracks, think of the five sites that you have most control over, these are the sites that you will work on for the track.

#### Track 1: Migrate your sites on Helix 5

> - Take 5 sites and migrate them to Helix 5. 
> - Keep notes in [this Slack Canvas](https://adobe-dx-support.slack.com/docs/T0385CHDU9E/F06TSUKFJER). 
> - Get help from: @stefan-guggisberg, @tripodsan, @dominique-pfister, @rofe

- switch over all the projects you are involved in to helix 5
- repoless projects (pga tour)?
- change tutorial to aem.page and aem.live
- change default new projects to helix5
- sidekick implications
- get outside-in, ideal project to work
- other test sites

### Track 2: Improve your sites based on RUM

> - Take 5 sites and look at the RUM data. Fix issues around CWV, missing pages, JS errors
> - Keep notes in [that other Slack Canvas](https://adobe-dx-support.slack.com/docs/T0385CHDU9E/F06TP81GR5L)
> - Get help from: @trieloff, @uncled, @langswei, @maxakuru

- RUM data collection clean-up
- RUM based site clean-up CWV and 404, JS errors
