# Project Helix Hackathon VII

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Hackathons)

The seventh Project Helix Hackathon will happen in the week of October 20th. It is still a few days out, but as space is limited, we ask you to register as soon as possible.

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

We do have the hotel from **Sunday** to Friday, so if you can accommodate, I recommend to fly in on Sunday.

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.
