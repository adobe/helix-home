# Helix Operations Workshop XVII

July 7th to 11th 2025, Basel, Switzerland
---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be made to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code to settle arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

We will meet up at the Adobe Basel office. Address: Peter Merian-Strasse 80, 4052 Basel (a 5 minute walk from the Basel SBB train station).
Our main meeting room for the week is "Morgestraich", with "Von Rappard" for break outs (both adjacent on the 4th floor)

#### Travel

Basel (BSL/EAP) is an international airport, with direct flights from many EMEA locations.

Zurich (ZRH) is an international airport, with direct flights from many overseas and EMEA locations.

Switzerland has good public transport, no need to rent a car:
- From Basel airport, bus #50 will take you to Basel SBB train station in 18 minutes
- From Zurich airport, there are many trains to Basel SBB, including hourly direct ones
- Within the city, you can either walk, take a street car (called "Tram"), bus or taxi to the hotel/office
- Basel hotels hand out [BaselCard](https://www.basel.com/en/baselcard)s for free public transport within the city

Hotel recommendation: tbd

### Preparation

> What can I do to prepare for the Hackathon?

1. Read the `README.md` and linked vision documents in this repo
3. Install the `aem` Command Line app and [create your first project](https://www.aem.live/tutorial)
4. Comment on the GitHub issues you think would be good candidates for the Hackathon

> This sounds DA-focused, how can I prepare for any DA work I might be interested in?

1. https://github.com/adobe/da-live <- UI
2. https://github.com/adobe/da-admin <- API
3. https://github.com/adobe/da-collab <- Collaboration
4. https://github.com/adobe/da-content <- Edge Delivery content provider

#### DA prep notes:
1. You only need the first repo if you're working on UI changes. Clone, `aem up`, and start hacking.
2. If you want the full stack, reach out to the DA team (Chris M, Karl P, David B, Markus, Hannes H, Alex C) for a `.dev.vars` file.
