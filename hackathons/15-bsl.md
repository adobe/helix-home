# Helix Operations Workshop XV

December 9th to 13th 2024, Basel, Switzerland
---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an operations workshop, are you going to operate all day?

In this operations workshop, we will discuss how we are operating our services, what changes can, should and need to be made to
improve quality of service for our customers and quality of life of our operators. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code to settle arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

Basel (BSL/EAP) is an international airport, with direct flights from many EMEA locations.

Zurich (ZRH) is an international airport, with direct flights from many overseas and EMEA locations.

Switzerland has good public transport, no need to rent a car:
- From Basel airport, bus #50 will take you to Basel SBB train station in 18 minutes
- From Zurich airport, there are many trains to Basel SBB, including hourly direct ones
- Within the city, you can either walk, take a street car (called "Tram"), bus or taxi to the hotel/office
