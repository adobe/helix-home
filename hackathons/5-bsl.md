* Discuss and work on next UI iteration with @kamendola
* Where and how do we document Helix?
* Improve Developer Experience for devs new to Helix, see [helix-cli/711](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/issues/711) (@stefan-guggisberg, @rofe, ...)
* Integration with project management tools (@bdelacretaz), looking at parallels with similar work that I'm doing for assets management.
* Discuss cold-start timing issues and expectations (@meryllblanchet @dunguyen @tripodsan @davidnuescheler)

#### Breakouts

As part of the hackathon there are a couple of items that require more attention and alignment, please find below a couple of proposals for breakouts and breakout hosts...

- [Whiteboards](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/raw/master/hackathons/5-bsl-whiteboards.pdf)

##### Breakout #1: Helix Pages and Overall Strategy

Proposed Time: Tuesday 14h-16h

Moderated by Karolin

* Pre-requisite: Have some exposure/understanding of helix pages 
* Roundtable: What do you think of helix pages and how does it fit into your overall vision of helix.
  * Everyone should be able to voice their opinion even if it is not a popular opinion
  * We accept all opinions for now; this is a brainstorming
  * I (Karolin) do have some controversial opinions to voice here; I know that and that's
    OK; I will also accept if we as a group decide to go in a different opinion (although no decisions are absolutely final)
  * We will at first just collect opinions (white board?); we will discuss them at the end
* Discussion

*Goals:* 
Shared understanding and definition of terminology and scope of things like Helix Pages, helix-cli, Bot, etc.
Come up with specific areas for an overall Roadmap (inclusive of helix pages) and architecture
Roadmaps should be specific, try to include who is most suited to perform the tasks, what needs to be done and how hard the task is.
Come up with a documented development plan, who does what?

#####  Breakout #2: Operations

Proposed Time: Wednesday 14h-16h

Moderated by Rofe

Some ideas for the breakout...

* Statement: What is the current state of operations?
* Who will be responsible to react to outages
  * Who can be notified when that person needs to escalate
  * Who from the adobe.io team can be contacted
  * How can we determine which person is qualified to fix what error
  * Who is level one
* Will there be an oncall rotation
* How to deal with nights?
* How will devs be notified about incidents
  * Just looking at a slack channel seems unsafe
* SLA? What are our performance targets? How will we define those?
* What will be our process to perform post mortems
* Who will manage the on call schedules, organize post mortems and such?

*Goal:* 
Come up with a documented plan, and assign responsibilities to implement a plan.

##### Breakout #3: Documentation

Moderated by Karolin

We plan to have two documentathons; during these, each of us will work to improve the documentation on some helix component they did not write themselves:

* What is the api of that component
* Why was it build?
* What is it good for?
* What should it not be used for?
* Are there any caveats to using that module?

*Goal:* 
Improve the documentation, share knowledge of parts of helix and reduce the truck factor in the helix team.

##### Breakout #4: UX

* [Awesome error messages](https://github.com/adobe/helix-simulator/issues/17)
* Helix Pages Admin UI

*Goal:*
Iterate/implement mock for error page, discuss & refine needs for config/admin UI in Helix Pages

##### Breakout #5: Quarterly planning for the Helix Development Team

Moderated by Rofe

##### Breakout #6: 

Moderated by Stefan

Work on [helix-cli/711](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/issues/711) 

*Goal:* 
Improve Developer Experience for devs new to Helix. A Developer new to Helix should be able to get his first Helix project running locally (including debugging), customized and published within half an hour, by just following a short concise tutorial and without any need for external help.

### Preparation

> What can I do to prepare for the Hackathon?

1. Read the `README.md` and linked vision documents in this repo
2. Join `#helix-chat` on Slack
3. Install the `hlx` Command Line app and create your first project
4. Comment on the GitHub issues you think would be good candidates for the Hackathon
5. Check out the [changes](#changes) made to Helix since the last Hackathon

## Changes

For occasional contributors to Helix it can get hard to keep track of what has changed in Helix since the last hackathon. Below, you can find a curated (i.e. incomplete) list of some of the most interesting changes to Helix since [the fourth Hackathon, i.e. Feb 1st, 2019](4-sfo.md).

### Helix CLI

- You can no longer use custom Docker containers for Helix, and Helix is using the Adobe I/O Runtime standard node.js by default, which speeds up cold starts [v0.13.4](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.4)
- When starting a Helix project, make sure to run `hlx auth`, which will authenticate the Helix GitHub app with your repository [v0.13.9](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.9)
- You can now use `.env` files to keep track of frequenly used environment variables like `HLX_FASTLY_AUTH` [v0.13.9](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.9)
- `hlx publish` now uses a remote service to update your Fastly config, so that you always have the lastest VCL, even when your `hlx` is slightly outdated. You can specify with service to use with the new `--api-publish` flag [v0.13.12](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.12)
- There is no longer a binary distribition for macOS. You have to install Helix CLI now using `npm i -g @adobe/helix-cli` [v0.13.13](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.13)
- The default pipelines are now even more customizable using the new `before` and `after` extension points [v0.13.13](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.13)
- In production, static assets will now get URLs that are immutable and can be cached in the browser for a long time. This improves performance [v2.0.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
- Selective publishing is possible through the `--only` and `--exclude` flags in `hlx publish`. All non-matched strains will get published with the latest configuration from `master`. [v2.1.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v2.1.0)
- You can now create (but not yet use) `cgi-bin` actions [v2.2.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
- Helix supports JSX as an additional templating language [v2.5.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli/releases/tag/v2.5.0)

### Helix Pipeline

- The `content.html` property has been removed from the `context` [v0.11.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v0.11.0)
- In section-content-detection, the `is-paragraph` class name is now called `is-text` [v1.0.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- The HTML pipeline now has additional extension points with `before` and `after` that can be used in a `pre.js` [v1.1.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
- Some pipeline steps are now allowed to mutate the return value (this disables merging for the current step) [v1.2.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.2.0)
- The context dumps in (`logs/debug`) now have more meaningful file names [v1.3.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.3.0)
- HTML heading tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) now have `id` attributes, so that they can be used as link targets for deep linking [v1.5.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.5.0)
- The XML pipeline exposes the same extension points as the HTML pipeline [v1.7.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
- Markdown documents can now have internal embeds (include another Markdown document) [v1.8.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
- HTML in Markdown is now supported [v1.8.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
- Links to static assets are now detected and rewritten into URLs that are cachable for a long time [v1.10.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
- HTTP headers can now be set from a HTL template by using `<link>` or `<meta>` tags [v1.11.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
- The HTML pipeline now parses the complete HTML document before it is rendered, allowing modifications through the `hast` extension point [v1.12.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v1.12.0)
- **breaking change:** Helix Pipeline now allows Pipeline steps to modify the `context`, which means all custom pipeline steps need review. [v2.0.0](https://github.com/adobe/helix-pipeline/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
