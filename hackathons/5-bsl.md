The hackathon will take place at the [Orangerie](https://www.designersfactory.com/orangerie/) at [Grellingerstrasse 75, 4052 Basel](https://goo.gl/maps/PY9tarrnA2S2). The nearest international airports are `BSL` and `ZRH`.

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

| Time      | Monday         | Tuesday                          | Wednesday   | Thursday    | Friday    |
| --------: | -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
|   Morning | -              | Helix Introduction & Demo Format | Programming | Documentathon | Demos     |
| Afternoon | Airport Transfer & Arrival       | Coding                           | Documentaton      | Coding     | Departure & Airport Transfer |
|   Evening | Set-up, drinks | Hacking                          | Team dinner | Hacking     | -         |

We will have two documentathons; during these, each of us will work to improve the documentation on some helix component they did not write themselves:

* What is the api of that component
* Why was it build?
* What is it good for?
* What should it not be used for?
* Are there any caveats to using that module?

The goal of this event is to improve the documentation, share knowledge of parts of helix and reduce the truck factor in the helix team.
