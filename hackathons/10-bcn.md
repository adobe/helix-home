# Project Franklin Hackathon X

November 28th to December 2nd 2022, Virtual + Adobe offices

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Hackathons)

With more than 2 years in solitude, [one canceled hackathon](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/blob/main/hackathons/9-bcn.md), and the memory of the 
[Palm Springs Hackathon](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/blob/main/hackathons/8-psp.md) rapidly fading, we wanted to try something new: **meeting in person**. 

Update: Unfortunately, once again, it didn't work out, so we'll **gather in Adobe offices instead and connect virtually** instead.

Attendees are encouraged to keep their calendars free for the week and join the others in one of the Adobe locations or via Teams for as much as they can.

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on stuff that won't
fit neatly into a 45-minute teams meeting.

**A general session will be active in [teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MTFkMDcyZmQtMTQ1NS00Y2Y0LTg0NTctNzE5NTMzNmFlZDZj%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22fa7b1b5a-7b34-4387-94ae-d2c178decee1%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%228e1c387c-908e-4926-b575-01fedf2f9b5e%22%7d) throughout the entire week.**
