# Project Franklin Hackathon X

November 28th to December 2nd 2022, Virtual + Adobe offices

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Hackathons)

With more than 2 years in solitude, [one canceled hackathon](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/blob/main/hackathons/9-bcn.md), and the memory of the 
[Palm Springs Hackathon](https://github.com/adobe/helix-home/blob/main/hackathons/8-psp.md) rapidly fading, we wanted to try something new: **meeting in person**. 

Update: Unfortunately, once again, it didn't work out, so we'll **gather in Adobe offices instead and connect virtually** instead.

Attendees are encouraged to keep their calendars free for the week and join the others in one of the Adobe locations or via Teams for as much as they can.

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on stuff that won't
fit neatly into a 45-minute teams meeting.

**A Microsoft Teams event will be active throughout the entire week.**
