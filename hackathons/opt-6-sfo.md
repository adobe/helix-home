# OpT-In VI

April 13th to 17th 2026, San Francisco, CA (Adobe Office)

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops, Hackathons, Rumathons, and OpT-Ins)

### Agenda

> I hear this is an OpT-In workshop, what exactly am I'm opting into?

Trying to get as much of the virtual team together, the goal is to have high-bandwidth exchanges on the current state and next steps of strictly neccessary Operational Telemetry. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

In the San Francisco office. We don't have a room yet, but it will likely have windows.

#### Travel

Fly into SFO and BART will take you to the city.

##### Accommodation

The closest hotel in walking distance is the Intercontinental San Francisco. The hotel is good, the walk to the office, while not terrible, involves seeing some of the rougher parts of the city.

### Goals

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

Put down the topic and the people that would like to discuss it:

The theme of this offsite will be determined based on team input and current priorities.
