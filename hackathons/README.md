## Ideas for future Hackathons

> Why don't we have a hackathon in…

Just put your idea on the list:

- Japan (somewhere in the mountains or in a cool city (not Tokyo or Kyoto :-)
- ~~Barcelona~~
- Bordeaux ( [Cité du Vin](https://www.bedouk.fr/la-cite-du-vin,L89668), [Opéra National](https://www.bedouk.fr/opera-national-de-bordeaux,L90884) )
- [Basel](https://www.basel.com/en) :)
- [De Watertoren](https://www.watertorenvlissingen.com/), Vlissingen, Netherlands
- New York City ([https://www.wework.com/l/new-york-city--NY](https://www.wework.com/l/new-york-city--NY), [https://privateevents.neuehouse.com/the-boardroom](https://privateevents.neuehouse.com/the-boardroom)...)
- ~~SoCal (L.A. / San Diego / Palm Springs), ideal for a winter location !~~

## Let's do it!

> How to organize a hackathon

1. Start a few months in advance, so that people have time to plan and get travel budget
2. Suggest a couple of dates and share a [Doodle survey](https://doodle.com/poll/g9y6sb72nz9yb7rw) on `#helix-chat`
3. Find and book a venue with: Wifi, space to work, hotels and restaurants nearby
4. Measure the network speed at the venue (in Basel we had 10MBps up, which was a bit on the slow side)
5. Copy one of the existing Hackathon pages
6. Invite everyone
