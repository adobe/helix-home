## Let's do it!

> How to organize a hackathon

1. Start a few months in advance, so that people have time to plan and get travel budget
2. Suggest a couple of dates and share a [Doodle survey](https://doodle.com/poll/g9y6sb72nz9yb7rw) on `#helix-chat`
3. Find and book a venue with: Wifi, space to work, hotels and restaurants nearby
4. Measure the network speed at the venue (in Basel we had 10MBps up, which was a bit on the slow side)
5. Copy one of the existing Hackathon pages
6. Invite everyone
