# Helix Hackathon Part VIII

Feb 10-14 2020, Palm Springs, CA

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Hackathons)

The eighth Project Helix Hackathon will happen in the week of February 10th. It is still a few days out, but as space is limited, we ask you to register as soon as possible.

### Agenda

> I hear this is a hackathon, are you going to hack all day?

We do have the venue from **Monday** to **Friday**, so if you can accommodate, I recommend to fly in on Sunday.

Although this is a hackathon, we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty of programming and coding.

The hackathon will take place at the [Ace Hotel & Swim Club](https://www.acehotel.com/palmsprings/spa-and-swim-club/swim-club/) at [701 E Palm Canyon Dr, Palm Springs, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/mYjj9XhUn8n1RB677).

The [Clubhouse 1st Floor](https://www.acehotel.com/palmsprings/events-and-spaces/event-spaces/spaces/) has room for 20+ people. 

#### Accommodation

While we do have reserved 10 hotel rooms with a special group rate (169$/night + tax & fees) attendees will be responsible for booking (and paying for) their rooms. Booking instructions will follow on the `#helix-chat` Slack channel.

**Important:** The contingent of 10 rooms with the special group rate is held until **January 10th** only, so please book your room before that date.

#### Transportation

Nearest large, international airport is LAX. We recommend pooling an Uber/Lyft or a rental car to Palm Springs (~2hr).
If you are flying from within the US PSP is the closest Airport and ONT is still a lot more convenient than LAX.
