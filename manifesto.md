# The Helix Manifesto

The Helix PACT is:

* **P**roduct Experience `#p`
* **A**rchitecture & Technology `#a`
* **C**ulture & Team `#c`
* **T**ools of the trade `#t`

### Open Meritocracy `#c`

We will work as meritocracy, input from others, and reviewing PRs and contributing to other projects is a top priority.

### Open Source `#c`

If we don't have a good reason why something should be private, it should be public. All new repos, live on public github.

### Diversity `#c`

We are a diverse team in every respect.

### No Meetings `#t`

(Virtual) Get-togethers, Show-&-Tells and [hackathons](./hackathons/README.md) only.

### More code, less blah, blah `#c`

Code wins. Everybody codes. Commits.

### Beautiful Creations `#p`

Well designed, beautiful output.

### Intuitive, Simple & Consistent `#p`

In that order.

### Available, Secure, Compliant  `#a` `#p` 

Always.

### Ops reliability wins `#a`

Simple, Fast and Up beats elegant.

### Global By Design `#p`

As global as the web with regards to languages, delivery, and performance

### Latency is not an option. `#p`

Uncached things are fast. <300ms fast. always.

### APIs first `#a`

Everything has an API, REST of course.

### Serverless `#a`

period.

### DevOps: Service, not Software `#a`

The software is secondary, what we build is a service. Pager Duty for everyone.

### Slack, GitHub issues, email archive `#t`

Discussions and decisions are open, asynchronous and archived.

### CI/CD `#t`

Results of commits can be seen in a production environment in 60 seconds or less.
### MVP Done Right

It's "minimum" when the team has doubts that it could work. It's viable when users don't care and use it anyway.
### Closed Loop `#c`

Listen closely to customer and user feedback. Measure qualitatively and quantitatively.

### Reluctant Dictator `#c`

Whether he wants it or not, the dictator has the last word on product and architecture

### Calibrated Risk-Taking `#c`

If we donâ€™t make a wrong decision once in six months, we are not ambitious enough. (Or self-critical)

### Get Jobs Done `#p`

The goal of the service is not to deliver features, but to get jobs done for our users and customers. 

### Extensible Delivery `#p`

URI, CSS, Client Code ... Edge ... (Server Code?)

### Embrace Authoring where it happens `#p`

Github, Google Drive and One Drive.


### JavaScript and Python `#a`

On the server-side JavaScript and Python are used for the respectively intuitive payloads.

### Mobile first `#a`

Native.

### Copy/Paste not drag and drop `#a`

Remember a good drag and drop experience on mobile?

### Frying Architecture `#a`

Output is assembled on request.

### Serviceful `#a`

Make maximum use of available services.

### Lighthouse Score `#a`

The goal is 100. Don't give it up.

### Lean and Mean `#a`

Less code is better. Actively manage the dependency graph to an absolute minimum.

### Opinionated, but Open `#a`

a.k.a. polished, but tweakable.

### Local Development `#t`

Support for simple local development is imperative. Low entry barrier.

### AI/ML `#t`

Power content, workflows, designs, and operations.

### Don't let your doc/sheet get weird `#a`

All documents (md, docx, gdoc, xlsx, sheets) should read well and intuitive when viewed/edited through their native interface.

### Nobody designs a list view before 2022

Let's design interfaces that are bold now, we can go back to safe and boring later on.

### IE11 is not supported

We will put no effort into making our code compatible with IE.
