# The Helix Manifesto

The Helix PACT is:

* **P**roduct Experience `#p`
* **A**rchitecture & Technology `#a`
* **C**ulture & Team `#c`
* **T**ools of the trade `#t`

### Open Meritocracy `#c`

We are a meritocracy, input from others, and reviewing PRs and contributing to other projects are a priority.

### Open Source `#c`

If we don't have a good reason why something should be private, it should be public. 

### Diversity `#c`

We are a diverse team in every respect.

### No Meetings `#t`

(Virtual) Get-togethers, Show-&-Tells and [hackathons](./hackathons/README.md) only.

### Async; but timely `#c`

We respond quickly and friendly. Even if it is just an ack.

### More code, less blah, blah `#c`

Code wins. Everybody codes. Commits.

### Intuitive, Simple & Consistent `#p`

In that order.

### Available, Secure, Compliant  `#a` `#p` 

Always.

### Ops reliability wins `#a`

Simple, Fast and Up beats elegant.

### Global By Design `#p`

As global as the web with regards to languages, delivery, and performance

### Latency is not an option. `#p`

Uncached things are fast. <300ms fast. always.

### APIs first `#a`

Everything has an API, REST of course.

### Serverless `#a`

period.

### Service, not Software `#a`

We build and operate a service. Pager Duty for everyone.

### Slack, GitHub issues, email archive `#t`

Discussions and decisions are open, asynchronous and archived.

### CI/CD `#t`

Results of commits can be seen in a production environment in 60 seconds or less.

### Closed Loop `#c`

Listen closely to user feedback. Measure qualitatively and quantitatively.

### Reluctant Dictator `#c`

Whether he wants it or not, the dictator has the last word on product and architecture

### Calibrated Risk-Taking `#c`

Wrong decisions lead to deprecation. Continously.

### Extensible Delivery `#p`

URI, CSS, Client Code, Feature Flags, Limits ... Edge ...

### Embrace Authoring where it happens `#p`

Github, Google Drive, One Drive and more ...

### JavaScript et al. `#a`

Languages that are main streamed on our platforms.

### Copy/Paste not drag and drop `#a`

Remember a good drag and drop experience on mobile?

### Frying Architecture `#a`

Output is assembled on request.

### Lighthouse Score `#a`

The goal is 100. Don't give it up.

### Lean and Mean `#a`

Less code is better. Actively manage the dependency graph to an absolute minimum.

### Opinionated, but Open `#a`

a.k.a. polished, but tweakable.

### Local Development `#t`

Support for simple local development is imperative. Low entry barrier.

### Don't let your doc/sheet get weird `#a`

Documents (html, md, docx, gdocs, xlsx, gsheets) are intuitive and understood by humans.
