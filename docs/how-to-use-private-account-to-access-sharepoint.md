# Helix 3 - Use personal account to access sharepoint

## Intro

You can use a personal account to access sharepoint for several reason:
1. to not give access to the generic `helix@adobe.com` user
2. to have more control on the sharepoint access API rate limits

## Overview

1. Generate github personal access token -> `GH_TOKEN`
2. Generate sharepoint refresh token -> `REFRESH_TOKEN`
3. Encrypt refresh token `CREDENTIALS`
4. Update fstab with `CREDETIALS`
5. Update edge dict with `GH_TOKEN`

**Note**: that this will use your account for all access to sharepoint (admin, word2md, indexer).
The refresh token expires after 1-2 (?) days.

**Note**: there is currently no trace in the logs which user is used to fetch content from sharepoint. If you want to ensure that your user is used, the easiest is to remove access for the `helix@adobe.com` user. Then all read and preview update requests must fail.

## Prerequisites

1. Get the doc2markdown service credentials from the Helix team

You will get those variables: `AZURE_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` and `AZURE_APP_TENANT`.

## Details

0. Generate a [github token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) - `repo` scope is enough. Let's call this `GH_TOKEN`
1. Get https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/helix-onedrive-cli 
```console
$npm i -g @adobe/helix-onedrive-cli
...
$ 1d --version
1.9.12
```
2. Create a `.env` file in your current working directoy and add the provided `AZURE_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` and `AZURE_APP_TENANT` variables.
3. Log in 
```console
$ 1d login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code C2VPNR35W to authenticate.
Logged in as: Tobias Bocanegra (tripod@adobe.com)
$ 1d me
Logged in as: Tobias Bocanegra (tripod@adobe.com) 
``` 

During login process, you should see a dialog to pick an account to be able to `sign in to Helix doc2markdown service`: use an account allowed to access the Sharepoint repository you want Helix to connect to.

4. Get refresh token and create credentials
```console
$ REFRESH_TOKEN=$(jq  '{ r:.[0].refreshToken }' .auth.json)
$ echo $REFRESH_TOKEN
{ "r": "0.ASYAWht7-...." }
```
5. Encrypt the creds using the admin
```console
$ echo $REFRESH_TOKEN | curl -si  -X POST --data-binary @- -H "x-github-token: $GH_TOKEN" https://admin.hlx3.page/encrypt  -H "content-type: application/json"
{
  "encrypted": "0Obexr7rFAP0JkFKCmvqeU2ghIMmaE....verylong...."
}
```
6. Update `fstab.yaml` to include the encrypted credentials and commit
```yaml
mountpoints:
  /:
    url: "https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/cg-helix/Shared%20Documents"
    credentials:
      - 0Obexr7rFAP0JkFKCmvqeU2ghIMmaE....verylong....
```
7. Test that the fstab is now in code bus
```console 
$ curl https://main--helix-test--tripodsan.hlx3.page/fstab.yaml --compressed
mountpoints:
  /:
    url: "https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/cg-helix/Shared%20Documents"
    credentials:
      - 0Obexr7rFAP0JkFKCmvqeU2ghIMmaE....verylong...
```
8. Access to private document should now fail:
```console
curl -si https://admin.hlx3.page/preview/tripodsan/helix-test/main/private/
HTTP/2 404
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
cache-control: no-store, private, must-revalidate
x-error: Handler onedrive could not lookup hlx:/tripodsan/helix-test/main/private/.
```
9. ...but using the gh-token should work:
```console
$ curl -si https://admin.hlx3.page/preview/tripodsan/helix-test/main/private/ -H "x-github-token: $GH_TOKEN"
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
cache-control: no-store, private, must-revalidate
accept-ranges: bytes
date: Mon, 25 Oct 2021 17:07:36 GMT
via: 1.1 varnish
x-served-by: cache-mxp6976-MXP
x-cache: MISS
x-cache-hits: 0
x-timer: S1635181653.005803,VS0,VE3250
content-length: 1062

{
  "webPath": "/private/",
  "resourcePath": "/private/index.md",
....
```
10. Add the github token to the `github_token` edge dict in the admin fastly service.

| key | value |
|-----|-------|
| `helix-test--tripodsan` | `ghp_....` |

Key format: `${repo}--${name}`

11. Wait (not clear yet how long but could take up to one hour?), and test again:
```console
$ curl -si https://admin.hlx3.page/preview/tripodsan/helix-test/main/private/
HTTP/2 200
....
```

12. Indexer
For the indexer, you need another credential: encrypt the refresh token using the admin with a token Indexer token provided by the helix team.
